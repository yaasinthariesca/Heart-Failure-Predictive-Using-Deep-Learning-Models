**Deep Learning**

Deep Learning is part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning whose algorithms take concepts from the structure of the human brain. The structure of this algorithm is called an Artificial Neural Network or an interconnected artificial neural network. Deep learning can be said to be the smartest machine learning because it is able to learn and adapt and can solve difficult problems. Deep learning can be used for Image Recognition, NLP, anomaly detection, and so on. There are several deep learning algorithms including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM), and Self Organizing Maps (SOM).

In this portfolio, I used Keras on Python and utilized deep learning techniques to build a model which 
consists of layers of Artificial Neural Networks to predict mortality caused by heart failure using the Heart Failure dataset obtained from Kaggle.
